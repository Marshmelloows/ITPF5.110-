              _When Betty Danford gambled and lost, she
               tried to dodge the consequences--but men
                cannot always be fooled or cajoled, and
                the best-laid plans oft go blooey._

[Illustration: _"This is the key to the south door," she said._]


Detective Harry Milholland finished his demitasse and thoughtfully
lighted a cigarette. Over the match flame he looked into the serious
and troubled blue eyes of the girl who sat opposite him in the private
dining room.

"Betty, you're the same old madcap! As spoiled as you are pretty,
and as selfish as you are sweet! And even though you turned me down
and married Chester Danford, it's terribly hard for me to refuse you
anything; but I'm going to refuse you this! It's a wild scheme and I
won't--"

"Oh, yes, you will, Harry!" Betty Danford interrupted, her blue eyes
pleading as she wagged a reproving finger at the man. "You haven't the
heart to leave me in this awful predicament when you can help me so
easily. Understand, I don't want _you_ to steal the necklace; I just
want you to hire some one to do it. Surely you know lots of clever
thieves who--"

"Who are behind the bars where they belong," Milholland finished,
smiling grimly. "Say, Bet, why don't you go right to your husband and
tell him the whole thing? Chester is good-hearted, and as square as
they make 'em."

"No!" Betty compressed her lips and shook her head emphatically. "Tell
Chester that I associated with those people? That I gambled and lost
more than I could afford? Confess to him that I pawned the diamond
necklace he gave me for a wedding present? And that I had a paste
necklace made to deceive him? I can't do it, Harry! Why, it took me a
week to muster up the nerve to tell you! And now you must help me! My
scheme--"

"How much have you lost?" Detective Milholland demanded abruptly.

"I won't tell you!" Betty pouted prettily. "I'm ashamed of it. Besides,
I wouldn't take your money even if you had any, and since everyone
admits that you're an honest policeman, I know you must be dreadfully
poor."

"I'm satisfied, Betty." Milholland smiled at the girl's naïve
frankness. "Say, why couldn't you steal the necklace yourself?"

"Because I'm too much of a bungler. I've discovered that I can't even
tell my husband a little fib without half choking. And the day I pawned
the necklace and told Chester that I was having it cleaned and repaired
was--was a regular nightmare. I'll never get over it. And I can't ever
wear the paste string again. It chokes me. I'm in constant terror of
my husband discovering the truth. Please don't keep me in torment any
longer, Harry! Get some one you can trust and have him steal the paste
string. I won't have to say a word. My darling hubby will think it was
the genuine necklace that was stolen--and he'll want to get me another
right away. In the meantime I'll have the pawnbroker break up the
necklace, sell the stones, and what's due me will clear up everything.
Please, Harry!"

"Don't coax, Betty! This thing isn't half as easy as you think."

"Don't you know a man you can trust?"

"Sure, but--"

"And that you can get to-night?"

"Yes, but--"

"Then it's settled!" Betty Danford opened her hand bag and got out
a key. "This is the key to the south door. Your man can get in with
this key and then leave it in my room. When he's ready to leave, he
can open the window in my room that lets on the porch roof, and go out
the door the way he came. Chester will think that I forgot to lock the
window and that the thief got in that way. There isn't much in the room
worth stealing except the necklace. That's in a secret compartment in
the bottom of the upper right-hand drawer of my dressing table. Your
man had better take out all the drawers and dump the contents on the
bed. Make it look like a real robbery. See, Harry? Well, when he does
that, he'll discover the catch that operates the secret compartment.
You can trust your man not to go into the dining room, can't you? Our
silverware--"

"You can't trust any thief too far," Milholland said grimly. "Where'll
you be? And your husband?"

"I'll get him to take me to dinner some place. There'll be no one in
the house. Better--er--what do you say?--pull the job early. Say, eight
o'clock. Then if your thief is seen going to the house, or leaving, no
one will think anything of it. Eh, Harry?"

"Eight o'clock will do, but--"

"But me no buts! Harry Milholland, how can you be so obstinate?"
Impulsively, Betty Danford reached across the table and "spanked"
Milholland's big hand.

"Darn you, Betty!" muttered the detective, drawing his hand away as if
the touch of the girl's fingers brought back an old heartache. "I don't
want to do this thing, but I suppose I'll have to. It isn't fair to
your husband, and I wash my hands of the whole affair. If anything goes
wrong--"

"It's all my grief! Certainly!"

"That wasn't what I meant, Betty."

"No matter! Cheer up, old gloom! And I must be going." The girl jumped
up and stepped around the table to the door. "Remember, I'm depending
on you, Harry! 'By!" Smiling, she blew him a kiss and was gone, leaving
Detective Milholland staring at the curtains, a troubled look on his
face.

       *       *       *       *       *

Chester Danford arrived late that evening and, to Betty's dismay,
promptly declared that he was tired, half sick, and was going to retire
at once. No, he didn't want any dinner! Go out? Absolutely impossible!

Betty, who all her young life had had her own sweet way, spent a
desperate half hour getting her husband to change his mind. And when it
was done, she could not shake off the feeling that she had aroused his
suspicions.

"Bet," he said as they were at the door ready to leave, "you seem
darned anxious to get me out of the house to-night. What's the idea,
hon? Surprise party, or something? And, say--why'n thunder don't you
wear your necklace any more? If this is a party, go put your sparklers
on. You look half naked without 'em!"

Betty glanced at her wrist watch. It was five minutes to eight!

"All right, dear," she murmured. "If it pleases you, I'll wear them."
She turned toward the stairway, then stopped. "No, Chester, let's do
this: have our dinner at once, then come back here. I'll put on the
necklace, all for you, and we'll go to--"

"You put it on now or I won't go a step," declared Chester Danford.

Betty stared at him, trying hard to hide her panic. "Chester Danford,
just for that I won't wear that old necklace to-night--or ever again!
How in the world can you be so obstinate?"

"The whole world is obstinate except you, isn't it, honey?"

"Certainly!" declared Betty, and tossed her head. "But, listen, sugar."
Betty went to the hall seat and sat down beside her husband.

Two minutes later the front door closed behind them. As Betty stepped
into the car she caught sight of a man strolling slowly down the
sidewalk.

"Don't like the looks of that fellow," muttered Danford as he eased the
car into the traffic. "You sure the house is all locked--windows 'n'
everything, hon?"

"I think so," Betty half choked. "But I'm so hungry I--I can't think."

"Wish we'd stayed home. Bet, I got something to tell you. Was saving it
for to-night--when we'd be all alone. Now that you've hustled me out of
my house and home I think I'll make you wait awhile. Eh?"

"What's it about?" demanded Betty quickly.

"W-e-l-l, just to tease you a little, I'll tell you this much. Old Abe
Arnstein has been a good friend of mine for years. Thinking, of course,
that my darling little wife wouldn't have any secrets from me, he let
something slip the other day. Well, here we are!"

"Let--something--slip!" The words came tonelessly from Betty's lips
as she leaned on her husband's arm and stepped to the curb. "What on
earth--"

"Don't talk here, Bet! Wait until we get a table."

Her appetite gone, Betty sat motionless while her husband gave the
order.

"I don't suppose it amounts to anything," Betty managed to say when the
waiter had left, "but what possible business could you have with Abe
Arnstein that would interest me, Chester?"

Instead of replying, Chester Danford reached in his inside coat pocket
and took out something wrapped in tissue paper, which he unfolded and
held up.

"My necklace!" blurted Betty. "How in the world?"

"I told you Uncle Abe was a good friend of mine," said Danford. "When
he discovered that I didn't know anything about your pawning your
necklace he was in a terrible stew. Finally I got the whole story from
him--and redeemed your necklace, of course."

Betty sat speechless.

"This afternoon I slipped home to tell you about it, but you were out.
So I went to your room and got the phony string Abe had made for you.
This is it. Do you--"

"This is it? Then where is the other--the genuine one?"

"Why, that's the surprise I was keeping for you, hon. I put your
necklace in the secret compartment where you had this thing.
Then--Gosh, Bet, what makes you so white?"

Chester's words seemed to come from afar off, yet they beat on Betty's
ears like cruel hammers. The glass of water she reached for seemed to
swim before her eyes.

"Close here--too warm. Back in a minute."

Her feet feeling as if they were made of lead, she ran for a taxi,
tumbled in and gave a frantic order. As the taxi started Betty glanced
at her wrist watch. Seven minutes past eight!

       *       *       *       *       *

So far as she could see, the house was dark when she reached home.
Telling the driver to wait, Betty hurried up the walk and let herself
in the front door. Punching on the lights, she ran up the stairs to her
room. One look--and she flew to the phone.

"Harry!" she gasped when the connection had been made. "There's been a
terrible mistake! I--"

"You better not talk over the phone!" cautioned Detective Milholland.
"That man hasn't got here yet. I'm to meet him at the east end of
Ellington Street bridge. You better hurry over there. I'll wait there."

Betty slammed up the receiver. As fast as her high heels could carry
her, she tumbled down the stairs and out to the waiting taxi.

Two shadowy figures were standing on the sidewalk some fifteen feet
from the end of the bridge when Betty slipped out of her taxi. As she
hurried toward the men she caught a glimpse of the broad, slow-moving
river, and the lights of the city beyond.

"So it's phony, eh?" one of the men shouted angrily. "Had me risk my
life for a bunch o' bum rocks, did yuh? Well--"

The rest, Betty did not hear. Horrified, she saw the speaker spring
back and raise his arm. His hand shot out. High over the bridge rail
flew something that seemed alive with sparkling flame.

Fleeing steps pounding on the walk--a blur of voices--strong arms that
caught her quickly--those were the last things Betty remembered.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Never dreamed you'd faint!" exclaimed Chester Danford when she had
regained her senses. "Harry and I were sure that a girl who had the
nerve to buck the gaming tables like you did could stand a little rough
play. Have another nip o' this Scotch!"

"No," said Betty firmly, pushing the glass away. "I--I want to think. I
came to in the taxi, recognized your voice, and got suspicious. I could
have walked into the house--but it was nicer to be carried." Betty
looked up at Detective Milholland. "So you--er--squealed, eh?"

"I did, Betty," Milholland admitted, accepting the glass Danford
offered. "I had to play square with your husband. You know, two wrongs
never make one right. So Chester and I framed it up to have one of my
own men slip into the house and get the phony necklace. Knowing, of
course, that you would phone me, I waited for the call, then hurried
to meet you. There, on the bridge, we went through the little play
suggested by Chester--and threw the paste necklace into the river!"

"Uh, huh." Betty's blue eyes were thoughtful. "Then, Chester, that
story you gave me about Uncle Abe spilling the beans was all a fake?"

"All except that I did redeem your necklace, hon. It was the real one
that I showed you to-night at the table. Gosh, you looked so sick I
felt sorry for you. If you hadn't got out so quick I'd have given in
and told you the truth. Well, it's over now; here--" Danford took out
the diamond necklace, but Betty waved it away.

"You keep it awhile," she said, rising. "I'm not going to wear it
until--until I feel that I deserve it. As for you, Harry Milholland,
I'm just going to murder you the first day I have time. Moreover, you
remember that this afternoon I was so grateful to you that I blew you a
kiss? Well, I want it back!"

Before the astonished detective could move to prevent her, Betty kissed
him smack on the lips. Then she slipped into her husband's arms.


                               THE END.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
